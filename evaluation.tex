\section{Evaluation} \label{sec:evaluation}

\subsection{Dataset}

For testing the transcription system, we employ the Bach10 dataset \cite{Duan2010}, which is a freely available multi-track collection of multiple-instrument polyphonic music, suitable for multi-pitch detection experiments. It consists of ten recordings of J.S. Bach chorales, performed by violin, clarinet, saxophone, and bassoon. Pitch ground truth for each instrument is also provided. Due to the tonal and homogenous content of the dataset, it is suitable for testing the incorporation of music language models in a transcription system. For training the transcription system, pre-extracted and pre-shifted spectral templates are extracted for the instruments present in the dataset, using isolated note samples from the RWC database \cite{Goto2003}. 

For training the MLMs we use the Nottingham dataset.\footnote{ifdo.ca/~seymour/nottingham/nottingham.html} We trained the RNN and the RNN-NADE models using both Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and HF to compare performance. The inputs to both the models are sequences of length 200 where each frame of the sequence is a binary vector of length 88 which covers the full range of the piano from A0 to C8. We train both the RNN and the RNN-NADE to predict the next vector given a sequence of input vectors. We train the models by minimizing the negative log-likelihood of the sequences using the cross-entropy objective $ \sum_{i}t_{i}\log p_{i} + (1 - t_{i})\log(1-p_{i})$ where i sums over all the dimensions of the binary vector.


\subsection{Metrics}


For evaluating the performance of the proposed system for multi-pitch detection, we employ the precision, recall, and F-measure metrics, which are commonly used in transcription evaluations \cite{MIREX}:
\begin{equation}
 \mathit{Pre} = \frac{N_{\mathit{tp}}}{N_{\mathit{sys}}},\ \
\ \mathit{Rec} = \frac{N_{\mathit{tp}}}{N_{\mathit{ref}}},\
\ \ \mathit{F} = \frac{2\cdot\mathit{Rec}\cdot\mathit{Pre}}{\mathit{Rec}+\mathit{Pre}}
\label{eq:PRF}
\end{equation}
where $N_{\mathit{tp}}$ is the number of correctly detected pitches, $N_{\mathit{sys}}$ is the number of detected pitches, and $N_{\mathit{ref}}$ is the number of ground-truth pitches. As in the public evaluations on multi-pitch detection carried out through the MIREX framework \cite{MIREX}, a detected note is considered correct is if its pitch is the same as the ground truth pitch and its onset is within a 50ms tolerance interval of the ground-truth onset.

\subsection{Results}

To validate the performance of the MLMs, we calculate the prediction precision on unseen sequences of music from the Nottingham dataset, where precision is defined in Eq. \ref{eq:PRF}. For both the RNN and RNN-NADE models we sample 10 vectors from the conditional distribution at each time-step and calculate the expected precision against the ground truth. The reported precision is found by finding the mean over the predictions of every frame. Table \ref{tab:prediction} shows the results of the validation experiments. These results are of the same order as the prediction accuracies reported in \cite{Boulanger-Lewandowski2012}.

Multi-pitch detection experiments are performed using the proposed system, with various configurations. A first configuration only considers the transcription system from Section \ref{sec:transcription}. A second configuration takes the output of the transcription system and gives it as input to the prediction system of Section \ref{sec:prediction}, where the final piano-roll is the output of the prediction step. A third configuration is the one presented in Section \ref{sec:combination}, where the recording is re-transcribed, having the prediction as a prior information for estimating the pitch activations. For the prediction system, experiments were made using both the RNN-NADE and the RNN.

Results using the various system configurations are displayed in Table \ref{tab:results}. As an example of the proposed system's performance, the transcription output using the 3rd configuration is displayed for a recording from the Bach10 dataset in Fig. \ref{fig:Transcription}, along with the ground truth for the same recording.

For comparison with the method of \cite{Duan2010} (where the Bach10 dataset was first introduced), the proposed method using the frame-based accuracy metric which is defined in the same paper by Duan et al., reaches 74.3\% for the NADE-HF using the 3rd configuration, whereas the method of \cite{Duan2010} reaches 69.7\% (with unknown polyphony).
