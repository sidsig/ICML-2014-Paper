\begin{abstract} 
In this paper, we investigate the use of Music Language Models (MLMs) for improving Automatic Music Transcription (AMT) performance. AMT is the process of converting an acoustic music signal into a symbolic notation, and is considered to be a fundamental problem in music signal processing. The MLMs are trained on sequences of symbolic polyphonic music. We train RNN-based models, as they are capable of capturing complex temporal structure present in the symbolic music data. Similar to the function of language models in automatic speech recognition, we use the MLMs to generate a prior probability for the occurrence of a sequence. The acoustic AMT model is based on probabilistic latent component analysis (PLCA), and prior information from the MLM is incorporated into the transcription framework using Dirichlet priors. We test our hybrid models on a dataset of multiple-instrument polyphonic music and report a significant 2.5\% improvement in terms of F-measure, when compared to using an acoustic-only model.

%Alternative abstract
%Automatic Music Transcription (AMT) involves automatically generating a symbolic transcription of an acoustic musical signal. The transcription can be thought of as the digitized version of the musical score corresponding to the music signal. It has been observed in previous research that a Music Language Model (MLM) which captures general structural properties of music (in the symbolic form), when used together with an AMT system, can benefit the overall quality of the transcription. In this paper, we present a novel method for making this combination using Dirichlet priors. \textit{NOTE: summary of technical details could go here}. By combining the predictions of a recently proposed RNN-RBM based polyphonic MLM with the transcriptions of a state-of-the-art PLCA based AMT system, we demonstrate improved transcription accuracy on the a dataset of multiple-instrument recordings.
